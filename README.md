Join us in a transformative AI hackathon focused on driving social impact in education and employability. Through this initiative, we will co-create innovative use cases that will power LearnAIx — an AI-assisted, open-source learning system.

With LearnAIx, our goal is to develop a scalable and accessible platform that can be leveraged by non-profits and other technology academies to enhance learning experiences and open doors to opportunity.

#### Purpose:

To empower learners and educators by embedding AI into Moodle-based learning journeys — offering personalized guidance, automated assessments, and contextual support. The platform is intended for use by non-profits and technology academies to upskill individuals in digital and career-ready competencies.

#### Objective:

To create practical, AI-enabled use cases that can be developed into Moodle plugins or integrations. These prototypes will lay the foundation for LearnAIx, turning Moodle into a smarter, more supportive learning ecosystem.

### Use cases

- LMS as a Service
- Feedback as a Service
- Student Engagement as a Service
- CMS as a Service
- Assessment Review as a Service
- LLM as a Service
- Proctored System as a Service
- Design the UX of the learning system

### Integrations & Tech stack

Hosting: Snowflake hosting
Plugins: Custom Moodle plugins using PHP, JavaScript, and REST APIs
AI Integration: OpenAI APIs, LangChain, or Python-based microservices
